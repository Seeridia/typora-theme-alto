## Introduce

**Welcome to the second generation of Alto!**

Alto is born to create a modern and elegant Typora interface, which has fully supported all Typora built-in themes (except for Dark mode) and most third-party themes.

Please use this theme with "Unibody" in Window Style.

Alto v2.0.0 is currently in pre-release.

## Credits

- The theme [Lapis](https://github.com/YiNNx/typora-theme-lapis) and its creator [YiNN](https://github.com/YiNNx)
- Some interface style inspirations are derived from [Arc](https://arc.net/) and [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365)

## Notes

- Since most of my modifications focus on the interface, you can easily apply them to other themes with minimal changes. To facilitate this, I have organized the interface-related changes under `Alto Style` in `alto.css` and placed the color settings under `Alto Own Color`.
- Please consider giving it a star ⭐.
- I'm just a freshman who recently started college, currently busy with competitions. If there are any issues you want to be fixed quickly, feel free to make adjustments yourself 👍.
- If you are not familiar with it yet, it's a good time to start learning. I am also a beginner, so there might be some immature code. I appreciate your understanding.

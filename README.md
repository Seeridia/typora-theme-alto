## Introduce

The theme retains almost all of the writing area styles from [Lapis](https://github.com/YiNNx/typora-theme-lapis) , while Alto significantly adjusts the interface styles.

Please use this theme with "Unibody" in Window Style.

## Credits

- The theme [Lapis](https://github.com/YiNNx/typora-theme-lapis) and its creator [YiNN](https://github.com/YiNNx)
- Some interface style inspirations are derived from [Arc](https://arc.net/) and [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365)

## Notes

- Since most of my modifications focus on the interface, you can easily apply them to other themes with minimal changes. To facilitate this, I have organized the interface-related changes under `Alto Style` in `alto.css` and placed the color settings under `Alto Own Color`.
- Please consider giving it a star ‚≠ê.
- I'm just a freshman who recently started college, currently busy with competitions. If there are any issues you want to be fixed quickly, feel free to make adjustments yourself üëç.
- If you are not familiar with it yet, it's a good time to start learning. I am also a beginner, so there might be some immature code. I appreciate your understanding.
